üéØ **Learning Objectives:**

* Master database programming skills using SQL and PL/SQL.
* Develop fundamental database administration skills.
* Gain hands-on experience with NoSQL databases (MongoDB).
* Understand and implement the software application development process, integrating database concepts.

üí° **Course Outcomes:**

Upon successful completion of this laboratory course, students will be able to:

* **CO1:** Design Entity-Relationship (ER) models for given requirements and translate them into relational database tables.
* **CO2:** Design database schemas in appropriate normal forms to meet specific requirements.
* **CO3:** Implement SQL queries using various SQL concepts to retrieve and manipulate data.
* **CO4:** Implement PL/SQL code blocks to address complex database operations and logic.
* **CO5:** Implement NoSQL queries using MongoDB.
* **CO6:** Design and develop applications that effectively utilize database concepts.

üìÇ **Practical Implementations:**

| Practical No. | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | **ER Modeling & Normalization:** <br> 1. Choose a real-world case study and formulate a problem statement (in groups of 2-3 students). <br> 2. Design a conceptual ER model using tools like ERD Plus or ERWin. <br> 3. Convert the ER diagram into relational tables and normalize the schema. **Note:** This problem statement will be used throughout the assignments to design and develop a mini-project application. |
| 2 | **SQL Queries (DDL & DML):** <br> 1. Design and implement SQL DDL statements to create tables, views, indexes, sequences, synonyms, and constraints.  <br> 2. Write at least 10 SQL DML queries (insert, select, update, delete) using operators, functions, and set operators, as guided by the instructor. |
| 3 | **SQL Queries (Joins, Subqueries, Views):** <br> 1. Write at least 10 SQL queries focusing on joins (inner, outer, self), subqueries, and views, as guided by the instructor. |
| 4 | **Unnamed PL/SQL Block (Control Structures & Exception Handling):** <br> 1. Implement a PL/SQL code block (using control structures and exception handling) based on a problem statement provided by the instructor (e.g., library fine calculation, area of a circle). | 
| 5 | **Named PL/SQL Block (Stored Procedures & Functions):** <br> 1. Write a stored procedure (e.g., `proc_Grade` for student categorization) and a PL/SQL block to use it.  <br> 2. The instructor will provide a specific problem statement. |
| 6 | **Cursors (Implicit, Explicit, FOR Loop, Parameterized):** <br> 1. Write a PL/SQL block using a parameterized cursor to merge data between two tables, handling duplicates. <br> 2. The instructor will provide a detailed problem statement.  | 
| 7 | **Database Triggers (Row/Statement Level, Before/After):** <br> 1. Create a database trigger on a table (e.g., Library) to track updates and deletions, storing old values in an audit table. <br> 2. The instructor will provide a specific problem statement and table structure. | 
| 8 | **Database Connectivity (MySQL/Oracle):** <br> Develop a program using a front-end language (e.g., Java, Python) to connect to a MySQL/Oracle database and implement basic navigation operations (add, delete, edit). |
| 9 | **MongoDB Queries (CRUD Operations):** <br> Design and implement MongoDB queries using CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), the `save` method, and logical operators. |
| 10 | **MongoDB (Aggregation & Indexing):** <br> Design and implement MongoDB queries using aggregation and indexing techniques. |
| 11 | **MongoDB (MapReduce Operations):** <br> Implement MapReduce operations in MongoDB with a suitable example. |
| 12 | **Database Connectivity (MongoDB):** <br> Write a program using a front-end language to connect to MongoDB and implement basic database navigation operations (add, delete, edit). |
